Insights

* Top customers are Lotus mart, Acclaimed stores, Vijay stores, Rel fresh, Coolblue, Propel Mart.
* The most sold category is dairy products. Orders are delayed at least half a day (0.42) on average.
* The loss in orders shows a decrease in the percentage of orders from different cities from March - August 2022 (5407 to 5100), which is close to 6%.
* The highest decrease in orders is from Ahmedabad, which is 7%, followed by Vadodara 5.4%. The delay date is proportional to the loss in orders. To decrease the loss in orders, we need to decrease the delay in orders.
* August is the worst-performing month in the given data period.
* The delay table shows that even when some of the orders are delivered on time, the In Full % plays an important role in retaining customers. This is very clear in Ahmedabad, which is more than 30%.
* The orders loss is highest in beverages, and the top loss products in order are AM Tea 500, AM Tea 250, AM Butter 500
