
Parental Leave Analysis

Introduction:
This project is an analysis of 1600 unique company parental leaves in weeks. The dataset was provided by Maven Analytics, and it contains information on the length of paid and unpaid parental leave offered by different companies across various industries.

Data Cleaning:
Before starting the analysis, the dataset was cleaned in Excel. The dataset contained many null and N/A values, which were replaced with '0'. The Industry column was also split based on the Industry and Sub-Industry, resulting in 50 distinct industries and 134 sub-industries. The cleaned dataset was then exported to both Power BI and MySQL for further analysis.

Data Exploration:
The data was further explored in MySQL to identify top companies and average leave weeks. This exploration helped to determine the most significant pieces for the Power BI report. By using different criteria and combinations, insights were extracted from the data.

Data Visualization:
The Power BI report included several key performance indicators (KPIs) to show the percentage of companies and average leave weeks for each type of parental leave. Different visualizations were used to show the top and least leave policies based on different criteria. Finally, insights were drawn based on the visualizations.

Conclusion:
This project provides insights into the length of parental leave offered by different companies across various industries. The analysis highlights the need for more paid leave for both mothers and fathers, and shows how parental leave policies can differ widely across industries. The Power BI report can be used by organizations to benchmark their parental leave policies against those of their peers, and make informed decisions on improving their parental leave offerings.
