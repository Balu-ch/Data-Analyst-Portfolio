Observations

Hotel pricing strategy can be categorized into three types: week day/weekend pricing, seasonal pricing, and dynamic pricing.
Fluctuation in weekly average daily rate (ADR) indicates that the hotel is implementing dynamic pricing, while a flat ADR indicates that there is no change in pricing and no dynamic pricing strategy to take advantage in the situation.
Dropping prices can increase the occupancy rate of hotels.
The occupancy rate of a hotel is directly proportional to its rating.

Insights

Luxury Category hotels are generating the most revenue, amounting to 1 billion.
Weekday sales generate more revenue than weekend sales.
The lowest price is offered for direct online bookings, while the highest price is for direct offline bookings.
The occupancy percentage of hotels is directly proportional to their ratings. The visualizations show the correlation between Property, City, Class.
Altiq Blu has the highest occupancy percentage and highest rating, followed by Altiq Palace in both, and Altiq Seasons has the lowest occupancy percentage and lowest rating, followed by Altiq Grands in both.
Mumbai is the city generating the highest revenue at 0.66 billion, while Delhi has the lowest revenue at 0.29 billion.
Altiq Exotica generates the highest revenue at 0.32 billion, while Altiq Seasons generates the lowest revenue at 0.07 billion.
Elite class hotels generate the highest revenue at 0.55 billion, while Standard class hotels generate the lowest revenue 0.31 billion.

Conclusion

Cancellation is proportional to revenue.
RevPAR is showing correlation to Occupancy%, revenue on weeks, and property.
We can see the weekly revenue heavily influenced by RevPAR that might be the main cause for low revenue weeks.
Week 30, 31 sales might be less due to the end of summer vacation.
Altiq Seasons are generating less revenue due to its being a business class hotel.
Note: Week 32 is excluded since it doesn't have all the data.
