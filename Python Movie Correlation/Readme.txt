Python Correlation Project on Movie Dataset
This project analyzes the correlation between different variables in a movie dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about movies including their gross, budget, production company, number of views, and ratings. The dataset is provided in a CSV file called movies.csv.

Project Overview
The project includes the following steps:
Importing the necessary libraries
Loading the dataset into a Pandas dataframe
Cleaning and preprocessing the data
Exploring the data and visualizing it using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps
Calculating and visualizing the correlation matrix
Building a regression model to predict movie gross based on the other variables
Evaluating the model and drawing conclusions


Files
The project consists of the following files:
movies.csv: the dataset containing information about movies
Python Correlation Movie Data Set.ipynb: the Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the project
README.txt: this readme file providing an overview of the project

Libraries Used
The project uses the following Python libraries:
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

How to Run
To run the project, follow these steps:
Clone the repository or download the files
Install the necessary Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Open the Jupyter Notebook file Python Correlation Movie Data Set.ipynb
Run the code cells in the notebook in order
Note: The notebook assumes that the movies.csv file is located in the same directory as the notebook file. If the file is located in a different directory, modify the file path accordingly in the notebook.
