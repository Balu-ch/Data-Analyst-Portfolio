# SQL COVID Project

This project is a SQL-based analysis of COVID-19 data. The project includes the following functionalities:

## Data

The data used in this project is from the start of the pandemic until 31-12-2022. The data was sourced from 'ourworldindata.org' and contains daily records of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations by country.

## Schema

The project includes a database schema that consists of three tables: 'cases', 'deaths', and 'vaccinations'. Each table includes columns for the country name, date, and the number of cases, deaths, or vaccinations. 

## Queries

The project includes several SQL queries that can be used to extract insights from the COVID-19 data. Some examples of the queries include:

- Total number of cases, deaths, and vaccinations worldwide
- Top 10 countries with the highest number of cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Daily new cases, deaths, and vaccinations by country
- Case fatality rate (CFR) by country

## Usage

To use the project, you can download the SQL script and run it on a SQL server such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server. The script will create the database schema and populate the tables with the COVID-19 data. You can then use the SQL queries provided in the script to extract insights from the data.
