Data Professional Survey in Power BI
Overview:
This project is a data visualization of a survey conducted on data professionals. The aim of this project is to analyze the data, clean and modify it in Power BI, and present key insights in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand manner.

Data:
The dataset used for this project contains responses from 630 data professionals who were surveyed on various topics related to their job, such as job satisfaction, salary, work-life balance, and preferred programming languages. The data was collected through an online survey platform and was anonymized to protect the privacy of the participants.

Tools Used:
This project was created using Power BI, a business analytics service that allows users to analyze data and create interactive reports and dashboards. The data was cleaned and modified using Power Query Editor in Power BI, and the final dashboard was published on Power BI Service for easy sharing and accessibility.

Data Cleaning and Modification:
The raw data was cleaned and modified using Power Query Editor in Power BI. The following steps were taken to clean and modify the data:

Removed irrelevant columns
Renamed columns to be more descriptive
Changed data types of certain columns
Replaced null values with appropriate values
Grouped and summarized data as needed
Created calculated columns and measures to analyze the data

Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations that provide insights into the data, such as:

The TreeMap visualizes the number of participants from each country.
The Donut Chart displays the average salary across all participants.
The Bar Chart illustrates the average salary for each role in USD.
The Stacked Chart showcases the favorite programming languages of the participants.
The Gauge Meters indicate the level of happiness with salary and work/life balance.
Each visualization is interactive, allowing users to filter and explore the data in different ways.

Insights
The average salary of females is higher compared to males.
The Data Analysis profession had the highest number of participants.
The United States had the highest number of participants with 261, followed by India with 73.
The average salary is highest for Data Scientists at $94K, followed by Data Engineers at $65K.
Data Scientists reported the highest levels of happiness with both salary and work/life balance.
Students and interns had the lowest average salary at $27K and reported being less happy with their salary and work/life balance.
Python was the most preferred language, followed by R.


Conclusion
Overall, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of the data professional survey, highlighting key trends and insights. While the data analysis presented is at a high-level overview, it has the potential to be conducted in a more detailed and impactful manner.The use of Power BI allowed for the cleaning and modification of the data in a user-friendly and efficient manner, and the creation of visually appealing and interactive visualizations that make it easy to understand the data.
