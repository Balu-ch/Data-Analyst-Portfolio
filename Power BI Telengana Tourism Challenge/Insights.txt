Suggestions :

To improve visitors in January and December (festive season), we could make promotions and ad campaigns and offer tourist deals.

Even though Telangana has many tourist spots, there are fewer players in the market in the tourism department. We could take advantage of government bus facilities and circulate certain bundles or packs with incentives, such as:

Historic places (Golconda fort, Charminar, Salar Jung Museum, Nehru zoological Park, Museums, Chowmahalla Palace) as a Historic Bundle.
Different famous temples as a Devotional Bundle.
Different theme parks, exhibitions, museums, planetariums, shopping malls as Kids and couples Bundle.

We could make few day tour trips for the bundles with room facilities and good food. We could also release a tourism app that shows the closest tourist spots if the person wants which is similar to Tsavari (app for Hyderabad Metro).

These suggestions will also work for foreign visitors but with slight changes.
